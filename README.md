## DTSC 1302 Final Project - Wage Disparities Analysis

## Description

This project, conducted by Group 6 for DTSC 1302 at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, focuses on the historical wage disparities between White, Black, and Hispanic people. Utilizing data from 1973 to 2022, the study specifically examines the wages of individuals with a bachelor's degree from 2000 to 2022. The analysis involves linear regression and the Seaborn package to showcase trends and correlations in annual incomes across these racial demographics.

## Key Features

Analysis of wage disparities based on race and education level.
Focus on data from 2000 to 2022 for individuals with a bachelor's degree.
Utilization of linear regression analysis and Seaborn for data visualization.
Exploration of the socioeconomic impacts and ethical implications of wage inequalities.

## Research Question

The project aims to answer: How do bachelor's degree wages for White, Black, and Hispanic populations compare to the overall average bachelorâ€™s wage from 2000 to 2022?

## Ethical Considerations

The project navigates potential harms such as reinforcing stereotypes and emphasizes promoting awareness and actions towards wage equity. It adopts a multifaceted ethical approach, considering virtue ethics, utilitarian perspectives, deontological approaches, and contextual sensitivity to socio-economic and historical factors.

## Conclusions

The project concludes a persistent wage gap among the studied racial groups, even when education levels are controlled for. White individuals consistently earn more, and the gap impacts various stakeholders like the workforce, students, and policymakers.

## Limitations and Future Research

The study acknowledges limitations in its dataset and suggests future research to dive deeper into the causes of wage gaps across demographics.
